## ⚙️ Functionalities
- In login page, there will be default admin credentials (username, password). You need to sign in using these credentials.

- Load all issues and display as per Figma

- On clicking on an open or closed tab, it will load the issues data of the related tab and show it in a display-like card in a 4-column layout like Figma. By default, it will show all data 

- Each card shows:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Status 
  - Author
  - Priority
  - Label
  - CreatedAt
- Clicking on an issue  card will open a modal and show all the information about that Issue. 

### 🚀 Challenges


- Show the card Top border based on their category(open, closed), open card will have Green Boder, closed card will have a purple border on top. 

- Loading spinner on data load

- Show active button on changing category names

- Implement Search Functionality and 8 meaningful github commit.  

- Create a readme file and answer this question on your own. Don’t copy-paste from Google or any AI chatbot.

## 📝 Answers to Questions

### 1️⃣ What is the difference between var, let, and const?
- **`var`**: Function-scoped or globally-scoped. Can be redeclared and updated within its scope. It is hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with `undefined`.
- **`let`**: Block-scoped (limited to the block it is declared in like `{ ... }`). Can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope. It is hoisted but not initialized, leading to a "Temporal Dead Zone".
- **`const`**: Block-scoped. Cannot be updated or redeclared. It must be initialized at the time of declaration. Note that for objects and arrays defined with `const`, the reference cannot be changed, but their internal properties/elements can still be mutated/modified.

### 2️⃣ What is the spread operator (...)?
The **spread operator (`...`)** allows an iterable (such as an array or string) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs are expected. 
- In arrays: `[...arr1, ...arr2]` merges two arrays.
- In objects: `{...obj1, ...obj2}` merges two objects.
- In function calls: `func(...arr)` passes array elements as individual arguments to the function.
